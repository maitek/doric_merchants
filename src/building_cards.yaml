# marble and ore
# buy any resource from bank for 5 drachma
# each turn each player gets more money, alternative can sell resources to bank for money (export)

# rank random rollouts by score and examine decisions to find balance
# can only produce one resource per building per turn (to limit production)
# since production takes time it is faster and better to trade for some items instead of producing everything by yourself
# simulate max score with all caeds available, what is max score with optimal luck?
# to balance players and prevent one player from getting to much money tax can be applied, e.g. 10% tax: players must give away 10 percent of their money (rounded down) after every income turn
